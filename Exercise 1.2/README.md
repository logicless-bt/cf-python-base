Allrecipes and recipes

#################################

I elected to use a dictionary to store each individual recipe. This is mandatory, because key-value pairs are essentially the only way to store each individual piece of information that each recipe needs. Technically each recipe could be a list filled with nested lists for piece piece of information, but that is simply a poor imitation of the real function of a dicitonary. However, a list is the perfect way to store each recipe, because they become easy to store, append, index, and access when necessary.
